'Cause I, I, I'm in the stars tonight
So watch me bring the fire and set the night alight

Shoes on, get up in the morn'
Cup of milk, let's rock and roll
King Kong, kick the drum
Rolling on like a Rolling Stone
Sing-song when I'm walkin' home
Jump up to the top, LeBron
Ding-dong, call me on my phone
Ice tea and a game of ping pong
This is gettin' heavy, can you hear the bass boom? I'm ready (Woo-hoo)
Life is sweet as honey, yeah, this beat cha-ching like money, huh
Disco overload, I'm into that, I'm good to go
I'm diamond, you know I glow up
Hey, so let's go

'Cause I, I, I'm in the stars tonight
So watch me bring the fire and set the night alight (Hey)
Shinin' through the city with a little funk and soul
So I'ma light it up like dynamite, woah-oh-oh

Bring a friend, join the crowd, whoever wanna come along
Word up, talk the talk, just move like we off the wall
Day or night, the sky's alight, so we dance to the break of dawn (Hey)
Ladies and gentlemen, I got the medicine, so you should keep ya eyes on the ball (Huh)

This is gettin' heavy, can you hear the bass boom? I'm ready (Woo-hoo)
Life is sweet as honey, yeah, this beat cha-ching like money, huh
Disco overload, I'm into that, I'm good to go
I'm diamond, you know I glow up
Let's go

널 위해서라면 난
슬퍼도 기쁜 척 할 수가 있었어
널 위해서라면 난
아파도 강한 척 할 수가 있었어
사랑이 사랑만으로 완벽하길
내 모든 약점들은 다 숨겨지길
이뤄지지 않는 꿈속에서
피울 수 없는 꽃을 키웠어
I'm so sick of this fake love, fake love, fake love
I'm so sorry but it's fake love, fake love, fake love

I wanna be a good man just for you
세상을 줬네 just for you
전부 바꿨어 just for you
Now I don't know me, who are you?
우리만의 숲 너는 없었어
내가 왔던 route 잊어버렸어
나도 내가 누구였는지도 잘 모르게 됐어
거울에다 지껄여봐 너는 대체 누구니

널 위해서라면 난
슬퍼도 기쁜 척 할 수가 있었어
널 위해서라면 난
아파도 강한 척 할 수가 있었어
사랑이 사랑만으로 완벽하길
내 모든 약점들은 다 숨겨지길
이뤄지지 않는 꿈속에서
피울 수 없는 꽃을 키웠어

Love you so bad, love you so bad
널 위해 예쁜 거짓을 빚어내
Love it's so mad, love it's so mad
날 지워 너의 인형이 되려 해
Love you so bad, love you so bad
널 위해 예쁜 거짓을 빚어내
Love it's so mad, love it's so mad
날 지워 너의 인형이 되려 해

Why you sad? I don't know 난 몰라
웃어봐 사랑해 말해봐
나를 봐 나조차도 버린 나
너조차 이해할 수 없는 나
낯설다 하네
니가 좋아하던 나로 변한 내가
아니라 하네
예전에 니가 잘 알고 있던 내가
아니긴 뭐가 아냐 난 눈 멀었어
사랑은 뭐가 사랑 it's all fake love

(Woo) I don't know, I don't know, I don't know why
(Woo) 나도 날 나도 날 모르겠어
(Woo) I just know, I just know, I just know why
'Cause it's all fake love, fake love, fake love

Love you so bad, love you so bad
널 위해 예쁜 거짓을 빚어내
Love it's so mad, love it's so mad
날 지워 너의 인형이 되려 해
Love you so bad, love you so bad
널 위해 예쁜 거짓을 빚어내
Love it's so mad, love it's so mad
